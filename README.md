# Simple Solana client

This client intends to facilitate the job of Solana program developers by creating
a GUI which they can use to interact with the Solana Dev Net.

I want to thank the creators of the following tutorials, which I used for guidance:
- https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/how-to-store-state
- https://github.com/canokaue/example-helloworld-video/tree/master/example-helloworld

## How to Use

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the application in locally.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits to the source code.\
